# **Make It a Home: Tokenized Real Estate and Repair Assistance**

## **Overview**
["Make It a Home"](https://detroitmi.gov/news/make-it-home-partnership-helps-nearly-100-more-families-become-homeowners) is a Detroit program enabling tenants of foreclosed homes to purchase their residences at a reasonable price with 0% interest loans funded by local businesses. This project integrates blockchain technology to:
- Tokenize real estate assets for transparency and efficiency.
- Streamline property tax tracking and rebate management.
- Facilitate critical health and habitability repairs.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Real Estate Tokenization**
- **NFT Representation:** Each property is tokenized as an NFT, holding metadata for:
  - Ownership details.
  - Tax compliance status.
  - Improvement history.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automate property sales, tax collection, and rebate allocation.

### **2. Health and Habitability Repair Assistance**

The "Make It a Home" initiative prioritizes critical repairs to ensure homes meet health and safety standards. Blockchain technology can streamline this process, providing transparent and efficient solutions for homeowners, community stakeholders, and local government.

#### **Repair Fund Management**
- **Tokenized Repair Grants:**  
  - Each homeowner can access repair funding through tokenized grants.
  - Grants are allocated based on validated repair proposals, ensuring funds are used effectively.
- **Community Repair Staking Pools:**  
  - Local businesses and individuals can contribute to a staking pool specifically for repairs.
  - Contributors are rewarded with tokens or ecosystem benefits, fostering local collaboration.

#### **Repair Proposal and Validation**
- **Proposal Submission via dApp:**  
  - Homeowners log repair needs through a user-friendly decentralized application (dApp).  
  - Proposals include descriptions, cost estimates, and supporting documentation like photos or inspection reports.
- **Smart Contract Workflow:**  
  - Proposals trigger a smart contract that routes the request for approval.  
  - Approvals are based on predefined health and safety criteria set by local regulations.
- **Inspector Integration:**  
  - Municipal inspectors validate repair needs and log approvals on-chain.  
  - The blockchain record ensures transparency and avoids fund misuse.

#### **Repair Progress Monitoring**
- **Transparent Updates:**  
  - Homeowners document repair progress by uploading photos, videos, and receipts to the dApp.  
  - All data is immutably stored on the blockchain, accessible to funders and inspectors.
- **IoT Device Integration:**  
  - Optional IoT devices, such as leak detectors, air quality monitors, or temperature sensors, can monitor property conditions in real time.  
  - Data feeds directly into the blockchain to validate improvements and ongoing habitability.

#### **Incentives for Health and Safety**
- **Automated Tax Rebates:**  
  - Repairs that improve health and habitability trigger pre-defined rebate calculations.  
  - Rebates are issued directly through smart contracts, reducing administrative overhead.
- **Property Health Score:**  
  - Each propertyâ€™s NFT includes a "health score" reflecting repair efforts and overall condition.  
  - Higher scores unlock benefits, such as lower interest rates on loans or priority access to additional funding.

#### **Community and Economic Impact**
- **Empowering Homeowners:**  
  - By making repair funding accessible and transparent, homeowners can address critical issues confidently.  
- **Incentivizing Local Collaboration:**  
  - Businesses supporting the repair pool contribute to community stability while gaining visibility and rewards.
- **Enhancing Property Values:**  
  - Regular repairs and improvements uplift property values, benefiting both owners and the broader community.

#### **User Flow for Repairs**
1. **Identification of Repairs:**  
   - Homeowner identifies critical repair needs or receives an inspection report outlining required fixes.
2. **Proposal Submission:**  
   - Repair details are submitted via the dApp, along with supporting evidence (photos, cost estimates).
3. **Approval and Fund Allocation:**  
   - Smart contracts route the proposal for approval. Once approved, funds are disbursed to approved contractors or the homeowner.
4. **Repair Execution:**  
   - Repairs are carried out, and progress is documented through regular updates.
5. **Completion and Validation:**  
   - Municipal inspectors validate repairs, and the NFT metadata updates to reflect the completed work.

This approach ensures that health and habitability remain a priority while leveraging blockchain technology to enhance efficiency and accountability.

### **3.Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for Make It a Home**

To support transparency and secure participation in the "Make It a Home" initiative, the system will leverage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). These will manage and verify stakeholder identities, ensuring secure interactions and ongoing engagement throughout the program. [Read detailed docs here.](https://github.com/johngulb/gods.work/edit/main/apps/web/README.md)

#### **Key Features of DIDs**
1. **Identity Management:**
   - Issue unique DIDs to each participant (homeowners, inspectors, funders, contractors).
   - DIDs are linked to roles, contributions, and activities within the initiative (e.g., property ownership, repair status).

2. **Secure Transactions:**
   - DIDs ensure that all property-related transactions, tax payments, repair approvals, and other actions are securely verified and tracked.

3. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Stakeholder records are dynamically updated on the blockchain, reflecting ongoing participation, repairs, and property improvements.

4. **Enhanced Trust and Transparency:**
   - The decentralized nature of DIDs ensures that all stakeholders have access to immutable and transparent records of participation and property status.

By incorporating DIDs, the initiative can provide a more robust and trustworthy system, improving engagement and accountability in the community.

## **Governance and Integration**
- **DAO Oversight:** A decentralized organization manages the community fund, approves proposals, and monitors tax rebates.
- **Government Collaboration:** Blockchain integration with local tax systems ensures accurate, real-time tracking and compliance.

---

## **Benefits**
- **Transparency:** Real-time tracking of ownership, tax payments, and repair progress.
- **Community Empowerment:** Encourages local investment and collaboration in housing initiatives.
- **Sustainability:** Incentivizes property maintenance and improvement for long-term habitability.

## **Next Steps**
1. Engage Detroit's local government, businesses, and community stakeholders.
2. Develop a prototype on a blockchain testnet (Ethereum or Cosmos).
3. Educate participants on using blockchain tools for homeownership and repairs.
4. Integrate DIDs for identity management and secure interactions.
